An Obsidian plugin that displays common Legend of the Five Rings icons within your markdown pages.

# L5R Symbols Replacer

**Version:** 1.6.2  
**Author:** MF False

A plugin for **Obsidian** that converts _Legend of the Five Rings_ shorthand symbols (like `(air)`, `(st)`, `(crane)`) into SVG icons both within the Obsidian editor and when published to **Obsidian Publish**.

It also provides commands to convert or revert these symbols across single notes or the entire vault.

## Configuring the Icon Folder

By default, icons are expected in:

```
vault:/L5R_Icons
```

You can change this in plugin settings:

- Example:  
    If your SVGs are stored in `Attachments/symbols/`, set:
    
    ```
    vault:/Attachments/symbols
    ```
    
- For **Obsidian Publish**, make sure the folder you specify is **included in your published files**.

## Copying the Icons into Your Vault

Before converting, populate your vault’s folder with SVGs.

1. Run the command:
    
    ```
    L5R: Copy bundled icons to folder (for Publish)
    ```
    
1. The plugin will copy all built-in SVG icons into your Icon Folder:
    
    ```
    by default:
    /L5R_Icons/
    ```
    
2. These can be used locally or published.

## Conversion Commands

### Convert Symbols → SVG (Single Page)

To convert only the currently open note:

1. Open the note.
    
2. Run:
    
    ```
    L5R: Convert symbols to SVG (current note)
    ```
    
3. Each `(token)` becomes:
    
    ```
    ![[L5R_Icons/token.svg\|18]]
    ```
    

---

### Convert Symbols → SVG (Entire Vault)

To process every note in your vault:

1. Run:
    
    ```
    L5R: Convert symbols to SVG (entire vault)
    ```
    
2. The plugin scans all Markdown files and converts each valid `(token)`.
    

---

## Reverting Commands

### Revert SVG → Symbol (Single Page)

If you need to edit your notes or revert for publishing:

1. Open the note.
    
2. Run:
    
    ```
    L5R: Reset SVG embeds back to symbols (current note)
    ```
    
3. Example:
    
    ```
    ![[Attachments/symbols/air.svg\|18]] → (air)
    ```
    

---

### Revert SVG → Symbol (Entire Vault)

To revert all embeds across every note:

1. Run:
    
    ```
    L5R: Reset SVG embeds back to symbols (entire vault)
    ```
    
2. All matching embeds (based on your **Base URL**) will be reverted.

## Notes & Tips

- **Pipe escaping:**  
    The plugin automatically escapes the `|` in embeds as `\|` to avoid breaking Markdown tables.
    
- **Reversion detection:**  
    Works with both `|` and `\|` forms.
    
- **Base URL sensitivity:**  
    Reversion is path-aware — it uses the configured Base URL to locate icons correctly.
    
- **Safe to repeat conversions:**  
    Running conversion commands multiple times won’t cause duplication or corruption.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem                   | Possible Cause           | Solution                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Nothing converts          | Tokens must be lowercase | Do not use `(Air)`                   |
| SVGs don’t show           | Folder not published     | Include your icon folder in Publish  |
| Reset didn’t revert icons | Base URL mismatch        | Confirm it matches your embed paths  |
| Table layout breaks       | Missing `\|` escape      | The plugin now escapes automatically |
